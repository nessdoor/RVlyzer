"""
This module provides the functionality necessary for analyzing a program's register usage.

The metric used is the one called "register heat", the "hotness" of the register in terms of time passed since the last
write on it. The hotness value can range between 0 (cold) and a user-defined maximum (hot).

By calling :fun:`rvob.analysis.heatmaps.register_heatmap()` and passing it a CFG, the register heatmap for the entire
program can be calculated, resulting in a (potentially very big) map, linking instruction lines to a vector-like
representation of the heat levels inside the register file.
